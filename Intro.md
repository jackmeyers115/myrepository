# The Beginning of Dinosaurs

The Mesozoic Era, also known as the "Age of Reptiles," lasted from about 252 to 66 million years ago and is famous for the rise of dinosaurs. This era is divided into three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous.

In the **Triassic Period**, life was bouncing back after a big extinction, and the first small dinosaurs and early mammals began to appear. The **Jurassic Period** saw dinosaurs become the dominant land animals, while the first birds began to evolve. Vast forests of ferns and conifers flourished. Finally, in the **Cretaceous Period**, flowering plants appeared, and well-known dinosaurs like the Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the Earth.

The Mesozoic Era was marked by warm climates, diverse ecosystems, and the incredible variety of plant and animal life that shaped the Earth.
