## Fun Facts About Dinosaurs

1. **Dinosaurs Dominated for Over 160 Million Years:** Dinosaurs roamed Earth for an impressive span of time—from around 230 million years ago during the Triassic Period to 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous.

2. **Dinosaurs Had Feathers:** While once thought to be scaly reptiles, many dinosaurs, especially theropods (like the ancestors of birds), were covered in feathers. Velociraptors, for example, likely had feathers.

3. **The Largest Land Carnivore Was the Spinosaurus:** Spinosaurus, a huge predator with a sail-like spine, was even larger than the Tyrannosaurus rex. It grew up to 50 feet long and spent much of its time hunting fish in rivers and swamps

4. **Dinosaurs Were Found on Every Continent:** Fossils have been discovered on every continent, including Antarctica, showing that dinosaurs were extremely adaptable and lived in a variety of climates.

5. **Birds Are Technically Dinosaurs:** Modern birds evolved from small theropod dinosaurs, meaning that, in a way, dinosaurs are not completely extinct—they live on as birds!
